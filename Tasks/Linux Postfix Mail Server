xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. We would like you to perform the following steps:

Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.

Create an email account anita@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by ksH85UJjhb.

Set its mail directory to /home/anita/Maildir.

Install and configure dovecot on the same server.

```
rpm -qa | grep postfix
yum install postfix -y
yum install dovecot -y
vi /etc/postfix/main.cf
  :set nu
myhostname = stmail01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
mydomain = stratos.xfusioncorp.com
myorigin = $mydomain
inet_interfaces = all
#mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
mynetworks = 172.16.238.0/24, 127.0.0.0/8
home_mailbox = Maildir/

systemctl start postfix               #if gives error then comment out ::1 from /etc/hosts to disable ipv6
systemctl status postfix
useradd anita
passwd anita
